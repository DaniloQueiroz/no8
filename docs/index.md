# What is is No8?

**No8** is a network framework for **Java 8** that makes the development of non-blocking/asynchronous applications easy.

**No8** uses eventloop concept to handle all the async computations, encapsulating all the complexity of using Threads, Executors and so on.

**No8** is under LGPL.

For *roadmap* and issues, see our [GitHub](https://github.com/daniloqueiroz/no8/issues).

See our [Getting Started](/getting-started/) page to see how to start developing your non-blocking application or take a deep look on [How it Works](/how-it-works/) to get a better understanding on **No8** internals.
